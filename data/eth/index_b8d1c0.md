## Core responsibilities {#core-responsibilities}

- **Inspire contribution in our open-source community across multiple platforms and projects.**
  - Whether it's the ethereum.org [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website), our [Crowdin translation program](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereumfoundation), our [Discord](https://ethereum.org/discord/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ethdotorg) communities, [running our community calls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI0p4e0dMuU&list=PLaM7G4Llrb7xy0mlM4uOtm4hAbtByFGTM&index=2), or just answering common questions for the curious, we rely on our community to drive our success.
  - We want you to take our community to new heights: engage with them on Discord and Twitter, coordinate contests, events, recognition campaigns, and generate ideas to expand participation and impact.
- **Work with Ethereum's wider community to facilitate collaboration.**
  - [Ethereum.org](/) is an important part of the Ethereum ecosystem. You'll work with partners and stakeholders to maximize our impact wherever possible.
  - Our content is kept up-to-date through a body of experts that our team has built relationships with over time. We’ll look to you to identify synergies and engage with potential collaborators, from individual contributors to larger organizations or DAOs.
- **Set and execute on growth metrics for community happiness and engagement.**
  - Building a fun, resilient community is essential to the long-term success of Ethereum. You’ll constantly be looking for opportunities to improve our communities experience.
  - We'll look to you to help establish what milestones we should strive for and to hold yourself accountable for achieving them.
- **Surface insights and distill community feedback to improve our products.**
  - You should have a product mindset and always look for opportunities to improve the content on [ethereum.org](/) and the UX in our web applications. You're excited to take an active voice in driving our product roadmap.
  - Have you answered the same question ten times this week? Are people reading [ethereum.org](/) content but still coming out confused? Are we getting consistent feedback from our community about a feature missing from something we built? What changes should we be making to address these issues? You should derive insights proactively.

- **You enjoy teaching as much as you enjoy learning**. You love to help - you get a sense of satisfaction out of seeing other people get excited about Ethereum. You're also always ready to learn - if you don't know an answer, you know how to find an answer.
- **You're comfortable pitching in to get the job done.** We're a small team, sometimes you may have to work outside your "core responsibilities."
- **You're knowledgeable about Ethereum and its ecosystem.** You understand the technology well enough to answer questions off-hand and are familiar with the larger projects, unresolved technical problems, and the broad strokes of Ethereum's roadmap and vision.
- **You hold Ethereum's values.** You're passionate about open-source collaboration, and decentralization, and truly want to see Ethereum succeed - not for your professional or financial benefit, but because you believe it's good for the world.
